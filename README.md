<h3>Data Visualization of Sky</h3>

Hi, I'm Jenny. <br>
This is the final project for the Data Visualization course at Parsons. <br>
As a sky lover, I always enjoy taking pictures of the skyâ€”they always make me feel calm and relaxed. <3 <br>
This project aims to <strong> explore and visualize sky data to showcase the healing qualities and beauty of sky colors. </strong> <br>
Hope you like it! <br>
<br>
