				About project
			</h1>
			<p>
				This is a project from the Data Visualization class at Parsons, aimed at learning how to visualize data through various methods and charts. Beyond gaining numerous programming skills, the most valuable takeaway from this class was understanding that data isn't just cold, lifeless chartsâ€”it can also be warm and human-centered. For this project, I chose to work with qualitative data, presenting the information I gathered in a simple, engaging, and accessible way for everyone.
